1. Project Title
Retail Insight: Men's T-Shirt Market Analysis Dashboard

A dynamic Power BI dashboard for analyzing brand positioning and performance in the competitive men's t-shirt market, focusing on pricing, product variety, and profitability.

2. Short Description / Purpose
This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of various men's t-shirt brands sold on a major e-commerce platform. It is designed to help retail managers, brand strategists, and marketing teams understand the competitive landscape and make data-driven decisions regarding pricing, inventory, and brand positioning.

3. Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

Power BI Desktop - Main data visualization platform used for report creation.

Power Query - Used for data cleaning, transformation, and shaping (e.g., handling null values, formatting text).

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) - Used for creating complex calculations for key metrics like Average Discount %, Average Sales Price, and Profitability measures.

4. Data Source
The data was collected via web scraping from a leading Indian e-commerce platform (e.g., Myntra, Ajio). The dataset comprises over 1,500+ unique t-shirt listings across more than 50 brands, including details on product name, brand, selling price, MRP, discount percentage, and customer ratings.

Which brands are dominating the market with the highest number of product varieties?

Which brands are employing an aggressive discounting strategy to attract customers?

What is the pricing hierarchy? Which brands are positioned as premium, mid-range, or budget?

Which brands yield the highest and lowest profitability, and what can we learn from them?
